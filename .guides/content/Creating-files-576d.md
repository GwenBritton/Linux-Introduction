## The `mkdir` command makes directories, but what about files?

Wonderful question! You may be guessing that in order to create or make files, the command would be something like: `mkfile`, right? Well, in this case it isn't.

Lets create a file inside our new _dir2_ directory:

1. Enter the _dir2_ directory
2. Execute: `touch file2.txt`

### Command: `touch`
__Definition:__
If any file does not exist, the `touch` command creates it with default permissions.

Additionaly, the `touch` command needs an _argument_, in this case, the argument is the name of the file to be created, don't forget the file extension: 

`touch file.extension`

__What is a *file extension*?__ File extensions are also known as _file formats_. You may be familiar with _.doc_ or _.xls_ for _Microsoft Word_ and _Microsoft Excel_ respectively. In most cases _file extensions_ determine the program that should or can read the file.
