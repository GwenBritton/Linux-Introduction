Wonderful question! In order to create files, execute the following inside our new _dir2_ directory:

1. Enter the _dir2_ directory
2. Make sure we are inside _dir2_ with the `pwd` command
2. Execute: `touch file2.txt`

__What is a *file extension*?__ File extensions are also known as _file formats_. You may be familiar with _.doc_ or _.xls_ for _Microsoft Word_ and _Microsoft Excel_ respectively. In most cases _file extensions_ determine the program that should or can read the file.
