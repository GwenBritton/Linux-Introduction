## What exactly does the `pwd` command output?

The similarities between the first line and the second line of the previous example are that both are displaying the _path to the working directory_, in this case the _workspace_ directory:

![pwd command home](.guides/img/pwd-command-home.png)

The _workspace_ directory, is the folder that contains the files and folders you are seeing in the _file tree_ or the first panel on the left:

### The _home directory path_
Notice the red rectangles in the example at the top? These are sorrounding the _tilda symbol_ `~` and the _home directory path_. The `~` symbol is just an abbreviation of the _home directory_. 

Whenever you log in to a computer, **a directory with the name of that logged in user (_codio_ in this case) is created on the _home directory_** to avoid users messing with other users folders.

In this case, the _workspace_ directory is stored inside the _codio_ directory which is stored inside the _home_ directory.
