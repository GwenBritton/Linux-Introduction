## Inputs and outputs

Let's review what we've done.

After typing the `whoami` command, you've probably got something like: 

```
codio ~/workspace $ whoami
codio
```

The first line, where you typed the command, is called __the command prompt__. In the second line, we've got an __output__ after executing that command by pressing the _return key_.

Basically, this is how the CLI works:

One important question to ask is how does the CLI recognize the `whoami` command?
