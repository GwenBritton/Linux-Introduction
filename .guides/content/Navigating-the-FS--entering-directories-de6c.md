## Can I go inside directories using the CLI?

_Bash_ provides a widely used command called `cd` or _change directories_ command that allows the user to navigate through directories, in order to see how it works perform the following: 

1. Click on the terminal window
2. Type `ls` to list the current directory contents, _return key_
3. Type `cd dir1` to enter the _dir1_ directory, _return key_
4. Type `ls` to list the _dir1_ directory contents, _return key_

That's it, you've learned how to enter a directory in _bash_ scripting.
