## What exactly does the `pwd` command output?

The similarities between the first line and the second line of the previous example are that both are displaying the _path to the working directory_, in this case the _workspace_ directory:

![pwd command current](.guides/img/pwd-command-current.png)

The `workspace/` directory, is the folder that contains the files and folders you are seeing in the _file tree_ or the first panel on the left, meaning that the _current location_ is the `workspace/` directory:

![filetree-screenshot](.guides/img/filetree-2.png)

The `workspace` folder is specific to Codio. If you were to use the CLI on another machine, it could be some other location you choose to store your project files.

We use Codio's file tree as it is simply a nice way to visualize a part of the file system.

### File tree
The _file tree_ is a __vertical and interactive representation__ of the files and directories stored in the computer's hard drive. In Codio we use the file tree you see on the left but Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder are the same thing.
