## What exactly does the `pwd` command output?

The similarities between the first line and the second line of the previous example are that both are displaying the _path to the working directory_, in this case the _workspace_ directory:

![pwd command current](.guides/img/pwd-command-current.png)

The `workspace/` directory, is the folder that contains the files and folders you are seeing in the _file tree_ or the first panel on the left, meaning that the _current location_ is the `workspace/` directory:
