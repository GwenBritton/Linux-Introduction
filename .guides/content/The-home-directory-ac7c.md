## What about the `~` symbol?

We learned that the `pwd` matches the current working directory with the `~/workspace` in the prompt, but what about the `~/` that comes before the `workspace` directory?

The `~` symbol, better known as the _tilde symbol_ represents the __home directory__.

Imagine a scenario where the same computer is being used by 3 different users: John, Anita and Tom. The computer is automatically configured to have 3 different directories, each of them with the corresponding user name inside the home directory:

John, Anita and Tom will have their own workspace directory without merging each others' files.
