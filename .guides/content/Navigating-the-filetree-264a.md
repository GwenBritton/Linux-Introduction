## `ls` to list, `mkdir` to create, how about entering directories?

We've learned that when executing the `mkdir` command, we create directories. Something that makes _bash_ pretty straight forward is that even though its commands are abbreviations of larger set of words, this abbreviations can be easily related to what the command actually does.

For example, the `cd` command lets you _change directories_ or navigate in and out of directories and directories inside directories or directories inside directories inside directories, and, ok I get it, how do I do it?

1. Click on the terminal window
2. Type: `cd dir1`
3. Press the `return key`
