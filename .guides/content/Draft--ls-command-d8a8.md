### Understanding the file tree

On the panel at the left of the terminal window, we've got the __*file tree*__.

#### File tree
__Definition:__
A way of displaying files and directories in a vertical representation. 

In most cases, this interface allows the user to click on directories that contain more directories or files on them.

_**dir1**_ is just the name of a folder or directory that is stored in the computer's memory. Directories can contain more directories or files inside them.

_**empty-file.txt**_ in the other hand, is the name of a file with the _.txt_ format that lives inside the current directory.

### The _home directory path_
Notice the red rectangles in the example at the top? These are sorrounding the _tilda symbol_ `~` and the _home directory path_. The `~` symbol is just an abbreviation of the _home directory_. 

Whenever you log in to a computer, **a directory with the name of that logged in user (_codio_ in this case) is created on the _home directory_** to avoid users messing with other users folders.

In this case, the _workspace_ directory is stored inside the _codio_ directory which is stored inside the _home_ directory.
