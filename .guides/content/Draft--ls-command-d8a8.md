#### File tree
__Definition:__
A way of displaying files and directories in a vertical representation. 

In most cases, this interface allows the user to click on directories that contain more directories or files on them.

_**dir1**_ is just the name of a folder or directory that is stored in the computer's memory. Directories can contain more directories or files inside them.

_**empty-file.txt**_ in the other hand, is the name of a file with the _.txt_ format that lives inside the current directory.
