## What exactly does the `ls` command list

Good question! Lets understand the `ls` command:

```
codio@anita-basket:~/workspace$ ls                                                                             
dir1 empty-file.txt
```

If you look at the output of the `ls` command: `dir1 empty-file.txt`, you'll notice that it matches the _dir1_ and the _emtpy-file.txt_ in the _file tree_. 

### Understanding the file tree

On the panel at the left of the terminal window, we've got the __*file tree*__.

#### File tree
__Definition:__
A way of displaying files and directories in a vertical representation. 

In most cases, this interface allows the user to click on directories that contain more directories or files on them.

_**dir1**_ is just the name of a folder or directory that is stored in the computer's memory. Directories can contain more directories or files inside them.

_**empty-file.txt**_ in the other hand, is the name of a file with the _.txt_ format that lives inside the current directory.
