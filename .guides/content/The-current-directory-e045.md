Good question! Lets understand the `ls` command:

```
codio@anita-basket:~/workspace$ ls                                                                             
dir1 empty-file.txt
```

If you look at the output of the `ls` command: _dir1_, you'll notice that it matches the _dir1_ in the _file tree_. 

_**dir1**_ is just the name of a folder or directory that is stored in the computer's memory. Directories can contain more directories or files inside them.
