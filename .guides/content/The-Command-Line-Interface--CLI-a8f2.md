## Introduction

The command line interface, better know as CLI, __is just another way to interact with the computer.__ 

Codio for example, uses a Graphical User Interface or GUI, as it has buttons, form inputs, text sizes, icons and so on... 

The CLI, often called _terminal_, _shell_ or _console_, __uses only text__ instead of more complex graphical elements in order __to give instructions to the computer__.

### Interacting with the CLI

In the left panel, we've enabled the _Codio Terminal_. This terminal is a Linux OS wrapper^1^ that uses __*bash*__, a _command line program_ that processes commands and returns output.

#### In case the Terminal is not enabled

You can enable or display the terminal panel either by clicking on: _Tools > Terminal_ in the Codio toolbar.

-- or --

With the `shift + alt + T` command.

#### Can you tell?

Even though the _CLI, terminal, shell and console_ concepts are used indistinctibly, there are some slight differences between each of them. 

Complement your knowledge by knowing the history and differences between each concept.
