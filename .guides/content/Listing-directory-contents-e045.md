## Let's list the `~/workspace` directory contents

So we now know that we are currently on the `/home/codio/workspace`. The `pwd` command tells us that.

__How do we list what's inside it?__

1. Click on the terminal window
2. Type `ls` into the prompt
3. Press the _return key_

### Command: `ls`
__Definition:__
The `ls` or _list directory contents_ command returns a horizontal list of the current directory and its contents.

### Did the `ls` match the file tree contents?

Considering that we are currently at the `~/workspace` (remember this is equivalent to `/home/codio/workspace`), then the `ls` command should have listed what's inside it.
