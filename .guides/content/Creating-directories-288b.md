## I now know how to list existing directories and files, lets create them!

_Bash_ commands show pretty useful when working with the _file tree_. For example, if you are asked to start a new software project, most certainly you'll need to create a directory that may hold more files and directories on it.

Good idea! Lets do that:

1. Click on the terminal window
2. Type: `mkdir dir2`
3. Hit the _return key_

Can you guess what just happened? Execute the `ls` command to verify the existance of your new _dir2_ directory.

### Command: `mkdir`
__Definition:__
The `mkdir` command _makes directories_. 

Additionally, the `mkdir` command needs an _argument_, meaning that the user needs to specify the name of the directory to be created in the following format:

`mkdir name_of_the_directory`

Note the whitespace after the `mkdir` command? If there's no whitespace, _bash_ will interpret it as another command.
