## Creating new directories and files

If you are asked to start a new software project, you'll almost certainly need to create a directory that can hold more files and directories inside it.

Lets do that:

1. Execute: `mkdir dir2`

There should be a brand new _dir2_ in your file tree, you can execute the `ls` command to verify the existance of your new _dir2_ directory as well.
